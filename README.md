# 🎭 Emotion Detection System  

A deep learning-based **Emotion Detection System** that identifies human emotions from facial expressions using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
The model is trained on grayscale facial images and can classify emotions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprise**, **Fear**, **Disgust**, and **Neutral**.
